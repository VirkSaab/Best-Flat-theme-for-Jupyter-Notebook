# Best flat theme for jupyter notebook
This custom theme is really beautiful and modern looking. It is based on flat design. Give it a try!


How to install:

*LINUX:

      Make sure your jupyter notebook is not currently running
      
      1. cd ~/.jupyter
      2. ls (show content of your folder)
      3. Now make a new folder named custom (if you don't have one in there)
      4. download given custom.css file and put it in custom folder.
      5. Thats it! start jupyter notebook.
      
*WINDOWS:

      Its fine if you are running jupyter notebook currently. Reload page to see changes.
      
      1. first enable Show hidden files and folders to show your hidden folder
      2. goto C:\User\username\.jupyter
      3. create new folder named custom if you don't have one
      4. if you already have custom folder:
              then just go in it and replace custom.css file with given file.
         if you just created new folder then simply paste given custom.css
      5. Thats it! reload page or start jupyter notebook.
   
*MAC OS:
      
     I'm sorry i don't have mac and i think steps are same as linux.
     Just locate your .jupyter folder and replace custom.css
